# Cube-Block-Game

This project was created to make a game of square blocks falling and having the user's mouse cursor to click on the block before it reaches the end. The user has a max health of 10 and each block that gets past the user minuses the health by 1. The point system for the blocks differ by the size of the block. The smaller the block the better the amount of points you can receive. 

This is my first game project using C++ and sfml.
